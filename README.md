# General-Python-Projects-2025
On this repo, I'll be posting general python projects going through different concepts such as dictionaries, lists, strings or even a combination of all of them.
In the second phase, I'll be goign through different functionalities concerning on one hand Python and on the other hand, the world of data science. a very fasinating world (Pandas, sklearn, scikitlearn...They are coming !)
I hope you will enjoy going through the codes and maybe use some of it for your own pieces.
